# Research: Local AI Model Integration

## Description
Research and evaluate options for running an AI language model locally within the Punch Card Project to reduce or eliminate dependency on OpenAI's API services. This would enhance privacy, reduce operational costs, and allow the project to function without internet connectivity.

## Objectives
1. Identify suitable open-source language models that could run locally
2. Evaluate hardware requirements for different model sizes
3. Assess performance and quality tradeoffs compared to OpenAI
4. Determine implementation approach and integration points

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Model Selection
- Evaluate smaller models appropriate for Raspberry Pi (or target hardware)
- Consider quantized versions of larger models
- Assess specialized models focused on specific types of content

### 2. Hardware Requirements
- Determine minimum RAM requirements
- Evaluate CPU vs. GPU acceleration options
- Assess storage needs for model weights
- Consider thermal implications during sustained use

### 3. Integration Architecture
- Design a compatible API layer to make the model swap transparent
- Implement fallback mechanisms for complex requests
- Consider hybrid approaches (local for simple requests, API for complex ones)

## Implementation Phases
1. **Research Phase**: Evaluate available models and their requirements
2. **Prototype Phase**: Test selected models on representative hardware
3. **Performance Optimization**: Tune models for best performance/quality balance
4. **Integration Phase**: Implement into the existing codebase
5. **Testing Phase**: Ensure compatibility and performance meets requirements

## Potential Options to Explore
- Llama 2/3 (quantized versions)
- GPT-2 distilled models
- TinyLlama
- MistralAI models (quantized)
- Phi-2/3 from Microsoft
- Specialized inference frameworks (llama.cpp, Text Generation WebUI)

## Priority
Low (Long-term research)
