## Description
Implement a flexible animation framework for the punch card display that can be used across both the GUI and the physical LED grid. This will allow for animations like sliding text, fading, scrolling, and custom patterns.

## Motivation
Animations add visual interest and can provide better feedback about state changes. A clear animation when a message is cleared or changed would enhance the user experience and showcase the capabilities of both the GUI and physical display.

## Current Issues
- No consistent animation system exists
- Transitions between states are abrupt
- No way to easily create and reuse animations
- Physical LED grid and GUI animations are not synchronized

## Proposed Implementation
1. Create a dedicated animation module
2. Implement basic animations:
   - Slide message from right to left (as requested)
   - Fade in/out transitions
   - Character-by-character typing effect
   - Visual feedback for errors or status changes
3. Design a simple API to create and register custom animations
4. Ensure animations work consistently across both GUI and physical LED grid

## Technical Details
- Create `src/display/animations.py` for the animation framework
- Implement animation classes with common interface
- Update display methods in both GUI and hardware controller to use animations
- Ensure animations are synchronized between GUI and physical display

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Basic animation library with at least 4 standard animations
- [ ] Sliding animation for clearing messages (right to left)
- [ ] Animation system works with both GUI and physical LED display
- [ ] Animation timing is configurable through settings
- [ ] Custom animations can be created and registered
- [ ] Animations respond correctly to changes in message size or content
