## Description
Implement the physical LED grid controller to display punch card data on a real LED matrix. The controller should communicate with the Raspberry Pi and synchronize with the GUI representation of the punch card.

## Motivation
The physical LED grid is a core component of the project that brings the virtual punch card to life. Current implementation only has placeholder code and simulation, but we need functional hardware integration to complete the vision of the project.

## Proposed Implementation
1. Create a dedicated hardware controller module in the project structure.
2. Implement the communication protocol between the main application and the Raspberry Pi.
3. Develop Arduino/Teensy code to control the physical LEDs based on received data.
4. Ensure the LED grid state is always synchronized with the GUI representation.

## Technical Details
- Raspberry Pi will serve as the bridge between software and hardware
- Communication via socket connection (TCP/IP) or serial
- GPIO pins will connect to LED controller board (Teensy recommended with OctoWS2811 library)
- Need to handle LED matrix of size 12x80 (standard punch card dimensions)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hardware controller module successfully communicates with Raspberry Pi
- [ ] LED grid displays the same data as shown in the GUI
- [ ] Changes to the punch card in the GUI are immediately reflected on the LED grid
- [ ] Animations and transitions are synchronized between GUI and physical display
- [ ] Fallback to virtual mode is automatic when hardware is disconnected
