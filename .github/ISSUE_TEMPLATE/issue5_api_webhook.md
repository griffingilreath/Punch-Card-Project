## Description
Implement an API or webhook that allows external services (like a website) to send messages to the punch card system for display and storage in the database.

## Motivation
Enabling external services to communicate with the punch card will expand its functionality significantly. This would allow for integration with websites, IoT devices, or other systems to send messages for display.

## Current Issues
- No current way for external services to send messages to the punch card
- Missing documentation on how such a system would be structured
- Security considerations for accepting external input are not addressed

## Proposed Implementation
1. Create a simple REST API server component
2. Implement endpoints:
   - Send message (POST)
   - Get current message (GET)
   - Get message history (GET)
   - System status (GET)
3. Add authentication for secure access
4. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Create documentation for API usage

## Technical Details
- Consider using Flask or FastAPI for the API implementation
- Implement in a new module such as `src/api/server.py`
- Ensure proper validation of incoming messages
- Add configuration options for port, authentication, and allowed origins
- Store received messages in the existing database

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API server can be started/stopped from the main application
- [ ] Messages can be sent to the punch card from external sources
- [ ] Authentication prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Messages are properly stored in the database
- [ ] API status is displayed in the GUI status indicators
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for API usage is created
