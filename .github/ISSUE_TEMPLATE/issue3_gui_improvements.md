## Description
Improve the GUI interface with a cleaner design, more functional settings menu, and working status indicators. The current interface needs aesthetic improvements and the status indicators do not properly indicate the state of various connections (OpenAI, hardware, etc.).

## Motivation
A clean, intuitive user interface improves the user experience significantly. The current settings menu needs refinement, and the status indicators should provide at-a-glance information about the system's current state.

## Current Issues
- Settings menu lacks a clean, modern look and could use better organization
- Status indicators in the main GUI don't properly show connection states
- Main GUI screen could be more aesthetically pleasing
- No clear indication of OpenAI connection, hardware status, or external API connections

## Proposed Implementation
1. Redesign the settings menu with a more organized layout
2. Implement functional status indicators in the main GUI
   - OpenAI API connection
   - Hardware connection (Raspberry Pi/LED controller)
   - External API status (if applicable)
   - Database connection
3. Improve the overall aesthetic of the main GUI screen
4. Ensure all indicators update in real-time as conditions change

## Technical Details
- Update `SettingsDialog` class in `src/display/gui_display.py`
- Implement status indicators in the `PunchCardDisplay` class
- Ensure status updates are propagated across the application
- Use appropriate colors and icons for status states (connected, disconnected, error)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Settings menu has a clean, modern appearance with logical organization
- [ ] Status indicators clearly show the state of:
  - [ ] OpenAI API connection
  - [ ] Hardware (Raspberry Pi/LED controller)
  - [ ] External API connections
  - [ ] Database connection
- [ ] Indicators update in real-time when status changes
- [ ] Main GUI screen has an improved aesthetic consistent with the project's style
- [ ] All UI elements are responsive and functioning correctly
