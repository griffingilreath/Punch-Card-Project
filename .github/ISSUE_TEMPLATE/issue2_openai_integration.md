## Description
Fix and enhance the OpenAI API integration to ensure it correctly connects, generates messages, and stores them in the database. Currently, the monkey patch implementation may not be working as expected.

## Motivation
The OpenAI integration is a key feature for generating creative messages for the punch card. The current implementation uses a monkey patch that may not be functioning correctly. We need to ensure reliable API connections and proper message tracking.

## Current Issues
- Monkey patch may not be properly handling API connections
- Generated messages might not be stored in the database
- Status indicators in the GUI don't accurately reflect the connection status
- API usage tracking is unclear

## Proposed Implementation
1. Evaluate the current monkey patch implementation and determine if it's still necessary
2. Implement a cleaner approach to OpenAI API connection if needed
3. Ensure proper error handling for API calls
4. Implement reliable database storage for generated messages
5. Update status indicators in the GUI to accurately show connection status

## Technical Details
- Review the OpenAI client creation in `src/core/message_generator.py`
- Check database implementation in `src/core/message_database.py`
- Update status indicators in the GUI to accurately reflect the state of the connection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenAI API connection is stable and reliable
- [ ] Generated messages are properly stored in the database
- [ ] Status indicators in the GUI accurately reflect the connection status
- [ ] API usage is tracked and displayed in the statistics section
- [ ] Error handling is robust and user-friendly
