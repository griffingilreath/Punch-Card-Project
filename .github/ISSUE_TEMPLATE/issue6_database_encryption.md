## Description
Implement optional encryption for messages stored in the database to enhance security and privacy. This feature will allow users to choose whether to encrypt stored messages.

## Motivation
Encryption adds a layer of security to sensitive data. While not immediately necessary for basic functionality, it aligns with the project's conceptual focus on message transmission and security.

## Current Issues
- Database messages are currently stored in plaintext
- No mechanism for securing sensitive messages
- Missing conceptual connection to the project's focus on message encryption/transmission

## Proposed Implementation
1. Implement a configurable encryption layer for the database
2. Add encryption/decryption functionality to the message database class
3. Create UI controls to enable/disable encryption
4. Provide key management options for the encryption
5. Ensure encrypted data is properly tagged in the database

## Technical Details
- Use industry-standard encryption libraries (e.g., cryptography package)
- Implement in `src/core/message_database.py`
- Add configuration options in settings
- Consider password-based key derivation for user-friendly encryption
- Add visual indicators for encrypted vs. unencrypted messages

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Optional encryption can be enabled/disabled in settings
- [ ] When enabled, messages are securely encrypted in the database
- [ ] Encrypted messages can be decrypted and viewed normally
- [ ] Migration path exists for encrypting existing plaintext messages
- [ ] UI clearly indicates when encryption is active
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Key management is user-friendly and secure
