# Enhancement: Raspberry Pi E-Ink Display Integration

## Description
Explore the integration of a 7-inch e-ink Waveshare screen with the Raspberry Pi via HAT connection for the Punch Card Project. This would provide an additional display option that may be more appropriate for certain types of information and would enhance the physical implementation of the project.

## Technical Considerations
1. **Hardware Compatibility**:
   - Determine if the e-ink HAT would interfere with the LED controller
   - Identify power requirements and constraints
   - Assess GPIO pin usage and potential conflicts

2. **Display Content**:
   - Define what information would be most appropriate for the e-ink display
   - Consider a simplified version of the GUI for the e-ink screen
   - Determine refresh rates needed for different types of information

3. **Software Integration**:
   - Develop drivers or integrate existing libraries for e-ink control
   - Create an abstraction layer to manage multiple display types
   - Ensure proper synchronization between LED and e-ink displays

## Implementation Approach
1. Research available Waveshare e-ink displays compatible with Raspberry Pi
2. Test a prototype setup to verify hardware compatibility
3. Develop a simplified UI for the e-ink display
4. Create configuration options to enable/disable the e-ink display
5. Implement content management that appropriately routes information to the correct display
