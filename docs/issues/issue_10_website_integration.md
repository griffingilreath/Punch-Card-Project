# Feature: Website Integration for Message Queue

## Description
Develop functionality to connect the Punch Card Project to a website, allowing messages to be saved and sent from the website to the application. This would create a bridge between the physical device and a web presence, enhancing the project's capabilities and audience reach.

## Functionality Requirements
1. Website component that allows message creation and submission
2. Secure API endpoint in the Punch Card application to receive messages
3. Queue system for managing incoming messages from the website
4. Authentication mechanism to ensure secure message transmission
5. Admin dashboard to manage the message queue

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Server Architecture
- Design a lightweight API server to handle website requests
- Implement secure authentication for incoming connections
- Create a persistent queue that survives application restarts
- Define priority rules for website-sourced messages vs. other sources

### 2. Website Implementation
- Develop a simple, period-appropriate form for message submission
- Implement feedback mechanism for successful message submissions
- Add message validation to ensure compatibility with punch card format
- Create user accounts or anonymous submission options

### 3. Integration Points
- Extend the existing message source system to include "website" as a source
- Implement polling or websocket functionality for real-time updates
- Create database tracking for website-sourced messages
- Add configuration options to control website integration features

## Implementation Approach
1. Design the API specification for the website-application communication
2. Implement the server-side API endpoint and queue system
3. Develop the website frontend for message submission
4. Create the message processing system for website-sourced messages
5. Implement admin tools for queue management
