# Enhancement: Physical Display Architecture Design

## Description
Develop a comprehensive plan for the physical display architecture of the Punch Card Project, detailing how different screens and display components will interact. This includes determining whether to integrate HDMI displays, e-ink screens, and how to present the GUI on the physical device.

## Questions to Address
1. Will the device include a small HDMI display on the edge for GUI visibility?
2. Should there be a dedicated e-ink screen for certain types of information?
3. How will the main punch card LED display integrate with supplementary screens?
4. What simplified version of the GUI should be displayed on the e-ink screen (if used)?
5. How should the physical layout be designed to maintain the aesthetic of a punch card while incorporating modern display elements?

## Technical Considerations
1. **Physical Design**:
   - Space constraints within the punch card form factor
   - Viewing angles and accessibility
   - Power requirements for multiple displays

2. **Display Integration**:
   - Cable management and connection types
   - Display synchronization
   - Software architecture to support multiple display types

3. **User Experience**:
   - Intuitive understanding of multiple display purposes
   - Consistent visual language across display types
   - Appropriate information routing to each display

## Implementation Approach
1. Create mockups of different physical layouts
2. Evaluate power requirements and physical constraints
3. Prototype different configurations to test usability
4. Develop a modular display management system in the codebase
5. Document the final architecture for implementation
