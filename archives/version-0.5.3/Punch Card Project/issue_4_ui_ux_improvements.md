# Enhancement: UI/UX Overhaul Based on Design Research

## Description
Improve the overall formatting and design of the Punch Card Project's interface to better align with the project's design research and provide a more consistent user experience.

## Specific Improvements Needed

### 1. Main Punch Card Display
- Apply design principles from the Interface Design History research
- Ensure consistent spacing and alignment
- Improve readability with appropriate contrast

### 2. GUI Console Standardization
- Create a consistent styling for all consoles in the application
- Ensure all messages appear in the appropriate console (fix console redirection issues)
- Standardize font, spacing, and color scheme across all console displays

### 3. Settings Menu Improvements
- Restructure settings menu for better organization
- Standardize styling to match the rest of the application
- Improve labeling and descriptions for better usability
- Consider implementing tabbed interface for better organization of settings

### 4. Design Research Implementation
- Review the design research documents in the Wiki (Design Language, Interface Design History)
- Apply appropriate vintage computing design elements from EPA's 1977 Design System research
- Ensure consistency with the historical accuracy of punch card systems

## Implementation Details
The UI styling is primarily handled in:
- `UIStyleHelper` class in `simple_display.py`
- Various UI component classes in `gui_display.py`

Proposed approach:
1. Create a unified styling system based on design research
2. Standardize console appearance and behavior
3. Improve settings dialog organization and usability
4. Ensure consistent typography and spacing throughout the application
5. Fix stylesheet parsing issues (noted in console output)

## Current Issues Observed
```
qt.qpa.fonts: Populating font family aliases took 37 ms. Replace uses of missing font family "Space Mono" with one that exists to avoid this cost.
Could not parse stylesheet of object QLabel(0x13a8e2ea0)
```
