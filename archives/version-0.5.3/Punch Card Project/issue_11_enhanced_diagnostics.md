# Enhancement: Advanced Diagnostic Screen Implementation

## Description
Develop a comprehensive diagnostic screen in the GUI that provides detailed visualization and monitoring of the Punch Card Project's components. This screen would offer a more technical view of the system, including LED status information, component connections, and operational metrics.

## Features Required

### 1. Enhanced LED Visualization
- Display a larger, more detailed overview of the punch card LED array
- Implement hover functionality that shows status for each individual LED
- Show metrics for each LED including time on, frequency of use, and current state
- Enable toggling of individual LEDs for testing purposes

### 2. System Component Diagram
- Create a visual diagram showing the connections between major system components
- Display real-time status of each component (active, standby, error, etc.)
- Show data flow between components with animation
- Provide interactive elements to explore component details

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Display real-time system performance metrics (CPU, memory, etc.)
- Show message processing statistics and queue status
- Track and visualize timing details for message display operations
- Implement historical graphing of system performance

### 4. Debugging Tools
- Add logging control and log level selection
- Provide direct access to recent log entries
- Implement component-level reset functions
- Create test pattern generators for the LED display

## Technical Implementation
- Extend the current GUI framework to include the diagnostic screen
- Implement data collection systems for component status information
- Create new visualization components for the diagnostic displays
- Add event listeners for interactive elements
- Ensure the diagnostic screen doesn't impact system performance
