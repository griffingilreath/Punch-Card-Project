# Punch Card Display Visual Bug Fix

The key fix for the visual bug in the punch card display was implemented in the `clear_grid` method:

```python
def clear_grid(self):
    """Clear the entire grid."""
    # Check if grid already empty to avoid unnecessary updates
    if any(any(row) for row in self.grid):
        # Reset the entire grid to False
        self.grid = [[False for _ in range(self.num_cols)] for _ in range(self.num_rows)]
        
        # Force a complete redraw of the entire widget
        # This ensures all visual artifacts are cleared
        self.repaint()  # Use repaint instead of update for immediate refresh
```

This fix ensures that the grid is completely cleared and redrawn, preventing visual artifacts from remaining after clearing the grid.
