# Punch Card Project

A modernized implementation of the IBM 026 punch card system for historical and educational purposes.

## Project Overview

This project provides a full GUI implementation of an IBM 026 punch card system, allowing users to experiment with this historical computing technology in a modern environment. It's designed for educational purposes to help understand the foundations of computer programming and data processing.

## Features

- Interactive GUI with authentic IBM 026 layout
- Card visualization and encoding
- Support for multiple character encodings
- Import/export functionality
- Historical reference materials

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
