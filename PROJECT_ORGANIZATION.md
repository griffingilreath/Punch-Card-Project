# Project Organization Status

## v0.6.6 Project Organization

After the v0.6.6 release, the project has been organized using the Git Flow branching model:

### Repository Structure

- **main branch**: Contains the production code for v0.6.6
- **develop branch**: Contains the development code for the next version (v0.6.7-dev)
- **tags**: All major versions are tagged (v0.1.0 through v0.6.6)

### Project Organization

1. **Code Structure**:
   - Code is organized into logical modules (src/api, src/core, src/display, src/utils)
   - Test files are located in tests/integration
   - Documentation is in the docs/ directory
   - Release notes are in release_notes/

2. **File Management**:
   - Backup files (.bak) are moved to archives/v0.6.6/backups
   - Integration tests are moved to tests/integration
   - .gitignore updated to exclude temporary files

### Git Flow Implementation

- The branching strategy is documented in [docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md)
- For future development, all new features should be created in feature branches from develop
- Releases should be prepared in release branches
- Hotfixes should be created directly from main

### Next Steps

For future development:

1. Create feature branches for new functionality:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

2. Merge completed features into develop:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff feature/new-feature
   git push origin develop
   ```

3. Prepare releases using release branches:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b release/x.y.z
   # Update version numbers
   # Test and fix bugs
   # When ready, merge to main and back to develop
   ```

### Version Management

- Main branch contains released version (v0.6.6)
- Develop branch contains v0.6.7-dev
- Version history is available in the README
