# Settings Manager

This document explains the technical implementation of the Settings Manager component in the Punch Card Project.

## Overview

The Settings Manager provides a centralized system for accessing, validating, and persisting application settings. It replaces the previous approach of scattered settings access throughout the codebase with a single, type-safe interface.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Configuration**: Single point of access for all application settings
- **Type Safety**: Settings are accessed with proper type validation
- **Automatic Persistence**: Settings changes are automatically tracked and saved
- **Organized Categories**: Settings are grouped by functionality for better organization
- **Default Values**: Sensible defaults are provided for all settings
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for configuration loading and saving

## Implementation

### Core Components

The Settings Manager is built around these key components:

1. **SettingsManager Class**: Central class that manages all settings access
2. **Settings Categories**: Organization of settings into logical groups
3. **Settings Dialog**: UI component for modifying settings
4. **Settings Storage**: Persistence layer for saving settings

### SettingsManager Class

The SettingsManager class provides a simple interface for accessing settings:

```python
class SettingsManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.settings = {}
        self.load_settings()
        
    def get(self, key, default=None, type_hint=None):
        """Get a setting with optional type validation"""
        value = self.settings.get(key, default)
        
        # Apply type conversion if needed
        if type_hint and value is not None:
            try:
                value = type_hint(value)
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                return default
                
        return value
        
    def set(self, key, value):
        """Set a setting and trigger persistence"""
        self.settings[key] = value
        self.save_settings()
        
    def load_settings(self):
        """Load settings from storage"""
        try:
            # Load from file
            # ...
        except Exception as e:
            # Error handling
            # ...
            
    def save_settings(self):
        """Save settings to storage"""
        try:
            # Save to file
            # ...
        except Exception as e:
            # Error handling
            # ...
```

### Settings Categories

Settings are organized into logical categories:

- **General**: Application-wide settings
- **Display**: Visual appearance and behavior settings
- **Animation**: Animation timing and behavior
- **API**: External API configuration 
- **Hardware**: Hardware connectivity settings
- **Debug**: Debugging and development settings

### Using the Settings Manager

To access settings from anywhere in the code:

```python
# Get the singleton instance
settings = SettingsManager.instance()

# Get settings with type safety
delay = settings.get('animation.delay', 100, int)
api_key = settings.get('api.key', '')
show_debug = settings.get('debug.enabled', False, bool)

# Update settings
settings.set('animation.delay', 150)
```

### Settings Dialog

The Settings Dialog provides a user interface for modifying settings:

- **Tabbed Interface**: Settings are organized into tabs by category
- **Type-Appropriate Controls**: Different control types for different setting types
- **Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid settings
- **Apply/Cancel**: Changes can be previewed before saving

## Security Considerations

The Settings Manager integrates with the keychain system for secure storage of sensitive settings:

- API keys are stored in the system keychain rather than in settings files
- Sensitive settings are never saved to disk in plaintext
- Access to secure settings requires proper authorization

## Known Issues

- Some settings aren't properly preserved between sessions
- Large configuration files can cause loading delays
- Settings dialog may not immediately reflect changes made programmatically

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements to the Settings Manager:

1. **Schema Validation**: Formal schema definition for settings structure
2. **Change Notifications**: Event system for settings changes
3. **Profile Support**: Multiple configuration profiles for different uses
4. **Import/Export**: Configuration import and export functionality
5. **User Permissions**: Different access levels for settings

## Integration with Other Components

The Settings Manager works closely with other system components:

- **Animation Manager**: Provides animation settings
- **Hardware Controller**: Provides hardware configuration
- **API Client**: Manages API connection details
- **UI Components**: Controls appearance and behavior
