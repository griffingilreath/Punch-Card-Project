# Version 0.7.0 - Component Refactoring

## Release Date: April 1, 2025

## Overview

Version 0.7.0 represents a major architectural improvement to the Punch Card Project codebase. The main focus of this release was to refactor the monolithic GUI display module into a more maintainable component-based architecture, paving the way for the future message bus implementation. This release preserves all existing functionality while significantly improving the code organization and maintainability.

## Key Changes

### Component Architecture

The main achievement of this release is the extraction of several core components from the monolithic `gui_display.py` file into individual, focused components:

- **PunchCardWidget**: The central visual component is now an independent widget
- **ConsoleWindow**: The logging and console functionality is now a separate component
- **InAppMenuBar**: Menu system has been extracted with its WiFiStatusWidget dependency
- **StatsPanel**: Statistics panel with its own standalone implementation
- **Settings Dialog Components**: Moved SoundSettingsDialog to a dedicated components directory
- **Utility Classes**: Extracted MessageGenerator, HardwareDetector, APIConsoleWindow, and ConsoleLogger

### File Reorganization

- Created a well-structured component directory at `src/display/components/`
- Renamed the main `gui_display.py` file to `main_window.py` to better reflect its role
- Created a settings subdirectory at `components/settings/` for settings-related components
- Added proper `__init__.py` files for clean imports

### Energy Usage Tracking

- Added a new Energy & Time Statistics section to the StatsPanel component
- Tracks active application time in hours and minutes
- Calculates energy consumption based on M4 Mac Mini's power usage (12.5W)
- Estimates electricity cost using a default rate of $0.15/kWh

### Technical Improvements

- Reduced the size of the main window module by over 70%
- Improved component separation with proper encapsulation
- Fixed several import-related issues during refactoring
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Enhanced maintainability through better code organization
- Eliminated code duplication across related components

## Future Plans

This release lays the groundwork for the upcoming Message Bus Architecture. The extraction of components was carefully planned as a preparatory step for implementing a message-based communication system between components, which will further improve the application's maintainability and extensibility.

The next version (0.8.0) will introduce:

- A central message bus implementation
- Conversion of component direct calls to message-based communication
- Clear message type definitions for all component interactions
- Documentation of the messaging protocol

## Issues Addressed

- [#27] Large monolithic GUI display module was difficult to maintain
- [#26] Component updates required modifying the main GUI file
- [#25] Code duplication between related components
- [#24] Tight coupling between unrelated functionality

- Development Team
- Griffin Gilreath (Project Lead)

## Additional Notes

This refactoring was performed with careful testing after each component extraction to ensure no functionality was lost or degraded. The application's UI and behavior remain identical to the previous version from a user perspective, while the codebase architecture has been significantly improved.
