## Description
Implement a series of improvements to the database system in the Punch Card Project, including enhanced statistics tracking, message numbering, content management, and a database viewer UI.

## Features Needed

### 1. Enhanced Statistics Tracking
- Track statistics for each letter used in messages
- Monitor message lengths and distribution
- Record the number of total messages in the system
- Track the number of openAI-generated vs. locally generated messages
- Implement caps for locally generated messages (suggested: 20) to prevent database overload

### 2. Message Numbering System
- Assign sequential ID numbers to all messages
- Store message IDs in the database
- Display message numbers in the UI when appropriate
- Enable retrieval of specific messages by ID

### 3. Database Viewer Implementation
- Create a dedicated UI component for viewing saved messages
- Implement sorting and filtering capabilities (by date, source, length, etc.)
- Add the ability to delete or export selected messages
- Display message statistics and analytics
- Provide search functionality

## Technical Implementation
- Extend the database schema to include new statistics fields
- Update message saving functionality to include automatic numbering
